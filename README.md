🧠 What I Learned
"I built this app in just 2 days. At first, it felt boring and tough, but I kept trying and never gave up. As Talha Anjum said:

وشش میرے ہاتھ میںk، میں نے کوششوں پہ کوششیں ہی کی ہیں

This app taught me about MediaPlayer lifecycle, UI synchronization, and the importance of continuous learning!"
